## Welcome to the FreeMiNT Project website

This website is a frontend for the [freemint github repositories](https://github.com/freemint).

## FreeMiNT Project

FreeMiNT project is a community based hub for several more or less related projects:

- FreeMiNT (kernel)
- XaAES (multitasking GEM AES replacement, part of FreeMiNT now)
- mintlib (libc for FreeMiNT and TOS, a C standard library)
- fdlibm (libm for FreeMiNT and TOS, a C math library)
- gemlib (GEM bindings for writing GEM apps)
- mintbin (set of, mostly deprecated, tools for manipulation with (Free)MiNT binaries)
- git (experimental fork for FreeMiNT of the popular version control system)
- m68k-atari-mint-gcc (gcc for FreeMiNT)
- m68k-atari-mint-binutils-gdb (binutils and gdb for FreeMiNT)
- freemint.github.io (project website sources, you're reading it)

Those are the main (and most important projects). There are several affiliated repositories, either for historical reasons or because the former SpareMiNT CVS server hosted them:

- CFLib (extension library for GEM programming)
- gemma (SLB based GEM library)
- HighWire (web browser)
- init scripts (basic shell scripts for system startup)
- MiNT init (/sbin/init and related programs)
- oVDI (Odd Stancke's VDI project)
- Phoenix (database GEM app)
- QED (GEM text editor)
- Smurf (GEM painting app)
- tos.hyp (most complete programmer's reference for TOS/GEM programming)
- vlogin (VDI login)
- xg (X11 6.4 for GEM)
